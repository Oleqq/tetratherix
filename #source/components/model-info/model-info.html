        <p class="section__paragraph">Similar to a ‘build-to-buy’ model, we partner differently to, and at earlier stages than, traditional medtech opportunities. Our return profile is different and not built on unilateral M&A. Smaller return at early stages but compounds to a far greater return over time.</p>
